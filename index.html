        <h6 class="text-center mw-75">Basically, if you're hired as a 1099 employee but do work like a W2 employee - you're probably misclassified. Below are some examples of what the IRS would consider to be "W2 behavior." In short, if you're a 1099 Independent Contractor - you must have a certain degree of independence.</h6>
